# Linear and Non-Linear Regression Analysis

This study focuses on the analysis of motorcycle data using linear and nonlinear models. This data is available in the "MASS" package in R.


**Goal:** 

Explore the data, understand if the data shows a linear or nonlinear relationship, and identify the best model that fits the data with good prediction accuracy. 


**Statistical Techniques**

We consider statistical techniques and models such as:
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Linear Regression Model
* Quadratic Model
* Fifth-degree Polynomial Model
* Splines - Regression Splines, Natural Splines, and Smoothing Splines.

**Main Findings**

The linear regression model does not provide a good fit for the dataset because the relationship between the variables is nonlinear. The quadratic and the fifth-degree polynomial fits do not do a good job either, but the natural spline and the smoothing spline with df=12.74 provide the best fit for the dataset. In addition, the smoothing spline is smoother and less wiggly.

**Project**

R and R Markdown were used for the coding and the creation of the project which can be found here: [Linear and Non-Linear Regression Analysis of Motorcycle Data](https://rpubs.com/Saidat/Linear_and_Non_Linear_Regression_Analysis)
