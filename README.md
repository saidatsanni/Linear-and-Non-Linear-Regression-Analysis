# Linear and Non-Linear Regression Analysis

This study focuses on the analysis of motorcycle data. This data is available in the "MASS" package in R.


**Goal:** 

To explore the data, understand if the data shows a linear or nonlinear relationship, and identify the best model that fits the data with good prediction accuracy. 


**Statistical Techniques**

We consider statistical techniques and models such as:
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Linear Regression Model
* Quadratic Model
* Fifth-degree Polynomial Model
* Splines - Regression Splines, Natural Splines, and Smoothing Splines.

**Project**
R and R Markdown were used for the coding and the creation of the project which can be found here [Linear and Non-Linear Regression Analysis of Motorcycle Data](https://rpubs.com/Saidat/Linear_and_Non_Linear_Regression_Analysis)
